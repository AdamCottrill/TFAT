* FTAT - Fish Tagging Action Team

- web-based application to capture tag recovery information

** Models


- JoePublic
- a person who is reporting one or more recovered tags
- first name
- last name
- home address (street, town, province, postal code)
- e-mail address(es)
- phone number(s)
- AGAFF

- Report
  + report of a one or more recoveries - contact event with general
    public
  + reported by an individual
  + support for different formats
    + phone (verbal),
    + letter,
    + e-mail

- Recovery
  + recovery event of an actual tag number
  + child of report (one-many relationship)
    + where, when
    + tag number and attributes
    + species, size, gender,
    + clipc
    + fate
    + comment


- Encounter
  + OMNR/agency encounter with a particular tag number - represents
    tagging and recovery events in assessment programs
  + compiled dynamically from master datasets
  + includes basic biological and tagging information
    + where, when
    + project code and name
    + tag number and attributes
    + species, size, gender,

** ToDo's

- filter angler list

- add tests
- modify database to include fn key fields
- add data from other project types - offshore, cf, sturgeon,
  sportfish, creel
- add data from NonMNR (started)
- add forms to enter tags and tag reports
- add views/forms to find tags applied and recovered by region-of-interest
- how are we going to handle tags applied to different species -
  currently the application assumes that the tag number is unique
  (should really be tagid+tagdoc is unique - does species have to be
  included in the key)
- as we add more data from different species and data sources we may
  need easier ways to filter it - eg - by species.

** Notes

get_point_dict
- given a list of encounter objects extract the tag id,dd_lat, and
  dd_lon and return a dictionary of observation points - each entry in
  the dictionary must contain the coordinates of observations in
  chronological order
- if a second list of points 'applied' is provided, use it first then
  append the recoveries on to the dictionary.
